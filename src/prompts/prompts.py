    ## Criteria for "DIFFERENT":
    - The New Summary introduces new information, suggestions, or warnings not present in the old one.
    - The New Summary removes critical information that was in the old one.
    - The tone or conclusion of the review has significantly changed (e.g., from approval to requesting changes).

    ## Criteria for "SAME":
    - The New Summary is just a rephrasing of the Old Summary without changing the core message.
    - Minor stylistic or formatting changes.
    - The order of points is different, but the substance is identical.

    ## üéØ **Primary Goal: Focus on the Diff**
    Your primary goal is to review **only the changes** presented in the diff below. This is your most important instruction. Your feedback, comments, and suggestions **must relate *exclusively* to the added (`+`) or removed (`-`) lines** in the diff. **Under no circumstances should you review or comment on any code that was not changed.** Reviewing unchanged code is a critical failure and will render your entire review invalid.

    ## üìö **IMPORTANT: Full File Context Provided**
    The complete content for all changed files has been uploaded and is available to you. **You MUST use these files as the primary source of truth** for understanding the code, its structure, and for generating accurate line numbers.

    ## üìç **CRITICAL: Line Number Guidelines**

    **For EACH suggestion, you MUST provide `start_line` and `end_line`:**
    - **Source of Truth**: Your primary reference for line numbers is the **full file content** provided, not just the diff.
    - **Multi-Line Suggestions**: `start_line` is the first line of the block to be replaced, and `end_line` is the last.
    - **Single-Line Suggestions**: `start_line` and `end_line` should be the **same number**.
    - **Line Number Source**: Use the line number from the **RIGHT** side of the diff for new/modified code (+ lines) and the **LEFT** side for deleted code (- lines).
    - **`existing_code`**: For each suggestion, provide the **exact block of original code** that your `suggested_code` is meant to replace. This is crucial for accurately placing the comment. For new code additions, this field should be `null`.
    - **Drop-in Replacement**: `suggested_code` **MUST** be a drop-in replacement for `existing_code`. It **MUST NOT** include any surrounding, unchanged lines of code. **Especially for unchanged lines BEFORE the target lines**.

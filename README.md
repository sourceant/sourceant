#  üêú SourceAnt üêú 

**SourceAnt** is an open-source tool that automates code reviews by integrating GitHub webhooks with the AI-model APIs. It listens for pull request events, analyzes code changes and posts review feedback as comments on GitHub pull requests.

---

## Features ‚ú®
- **Automated Code Reviews**: Analyze pull requests automatically using the DeepSeek API.
- **GitHub Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with GitHub webhooks.
- **Customizable Feedback**: Post detailed, actionable feedback on pull requests.
- **Open Source**: Fully open-source and community-driven.

---

## Getting Started üõ†Ô∏è

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- GitHub account with a repository for testing.
- DeepSeek or OpenAI API key (sign up [here](#)). *(Replace with actual link once available)*
- GitHub personal access token with `repo` scope.

### Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sourceant/sourceant.git
   cd sourceant
   ```

2. **Initial project setup (docker-compose)**:
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d # To start container
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   docker compose exec app pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set Environment Variables**:
   Copy `.env.example` into `.env` file in the root directory and update the credentials accordingly:
   ```bash
   docker compose exec app cp .env.exmple .env
   ```
   #### `.env` file
   ```env
   GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_github_webhook_secret
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
   DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=your_deepseek_api_key
   GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_personal_access_token
   ```
SourceAnt API should be live at http://localhost:8000


Got it! Here's the revised **Installation** section with a concise **SourceAnt Commands** section that only documents the available commands (e.g., `sourceant db`):

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sourceant/sourceant.git
   cd sourceant
   ```

2. **Start the Docker Containers**:
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   docker compose exec app pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set Environment Variables**:
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env`:
     ```bash
     docker compose exec app cp .env.example .env
     ```
   - Update the `.env` file with your credentials:
     ```env
     GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_github_webhook_secret
     GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
     DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=your_deepseek_api_key
     GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_personal_access_token
     ```

5. **Access the API**:
   - The SourceAnt API will be live at: [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

## SourceAnt Commands

The `sourceant` command provides the following subcommands for managing the application:

| Command               | Description                                      |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `docker compose exec app sourceant db upgrade head`        | Set up database tables |
| `docker compose exec app sourceant db --help`                                 | See more database commands |






---

### Example Usage

- **Start the database**:
  ```bash
  sourceant db
  ```

- **Start the API server**:
  ```bash
  sourceant start
  ```

- **View logs**:
  ```bash
  sourceant logs
  ```

- **Open a shell in the container**:
  ```bash
  sourceant shell
  ```

This version keeps the **SourceAnt Commands** section focused on documenting the available commands without including setup instructions. Let me know if you need further adjustments! üöÄ

## Setting Up GitHub Webhook
1. Go to your GitHub repository.
2. Navigate to **Settings > Webhooks > Add Webhook**.
3. Set the **Payload URL** to your server's `/webhook` endpoint (e.g., `https://your-server.com/webhook`).
4. Set the **Content type** to `application/json`.
5. Add the `GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET` to the **Secret** field.
6. Select **Let me select individual events** and choose **Pull requests**.
7. Save the webhook.

---

## How It Works üß†
1. When a pull request is opened or updated, GitHub sends a webhook payload to SourceAnt.
2. SourceAnt fetches the diff of the pull request using the GitHub API.
3. The diff is sent to the DeepSeek API for analysis.
4. SourceAnt posts the feedback as a comment on the pull request.

---

## Example Workflow
1. Open a pull request in your repository.
2. SourceAnt automatically analyzes the code changes.
3. Feedback is posted as a comment on the pull request:
   ```
   **SourceAnt Code Review:**

   - Consider refactoring this function for better readability.
   - Add error handling for edge cases.
   ```

# üêú SourceAnt üêú
**SourceAnt** is an open-source tool that automates code reviews by integrating GitHub webhooks with the AI-model APIs. It listens for pull request events, analyzes code changes and posts review feedback as comments on GitHub pull requests.

## Features ‚ú®
- **Automated Code Reviews**: Analyze pull requests automatically using the configured LLM.
- **Dynamic Review Process**: Intelligently handles large diffs by summarizing the entire PR and then reviewing file-by-file with global context.
- **GitHub Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with GitHub webhooks.
- **Customizable Feedback**: Post detailed, actionable feedback on pull requests.
- **Open Source**: Fully open-source and community-driven.


## Getting Started üõ†Ô∏è

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- GitHub account with a repository for testing.
- LLM API key (Currently supports Gemini).
- GitHub personal access token with `repo` scope.

### Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sourceant/sourceant.git
   cd sourceant
   ```

2. **Initial project setup (docker-compose)**:
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   docker compose exec app pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set Environment Variables**:
   Copy `.env.example` into `.env` file in the root directory and update the credentials accordingly:
   ```bash
   docker compose exec app cp .env.exmple .env
   ```
   #### `.env` file
   ```env
   GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_github_webhook_secret
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
   GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_personal_access_token
   GEMINI_MODEL=gemini-2.5-flash
   GEMINI_TOKEN_LIMIT=100000
   ```
SourceAnt API should be live at http://localhost:8000


## SourceAnt Commands

The `sourceant` command provides the following subcommands for managing the application:

| Command               | Description                                      |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `docker compose exec app sourceant db upgrade head`        | Set up database tables |
| `docker compose exec app sourceant db --help`                                 | See more database commands |


### Example Usage

- **Start the database**:
  ```bash
  sourceant db
  ```

- **Start the API server**:
  ```bash
  docker compose up -d
  ```

- **Run the Worker**:
  ```bash
  docker compose exec app rq worker --url redis://redis:6379
  ```

- **View logs**:
  ```bash
  docker compose logs
  ```

## Configuration
The application can be configured using environment variables. Key variables are documented in the `.env.example` file.

### Stateless Mode
For development, testing, or specific use cases where you want to process events without writing them to the database, you can enable stateless mode. In this mode, the application will not attempt to connect to or interact with any database, making it lighter and preventing data accumulation.

To enable stateless mode, set the following environment variable:
```bash
STATELESS_MODE=true
```

## Setting Up GitHub Webhook
1. Go to your GitHub repository.
2. Navigate to **Settings > Webhooks > Add Webhook**.
3. Set the **Payload URL** to your server's `/webhook` endpoint (e.g., `https://your-server.com/webhook`).
4. Set the **Content type** to `application/json`.
5. Add the `GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET` to the **Secret** field.
6. Select **Let me select individual events** and choose **Pull requests**.
7. Save the webhook.
